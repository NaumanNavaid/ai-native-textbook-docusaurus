# Chapter 2: Neural Networks for Robotics
*Deep learning approaches for perception and control*

# Introduction

Neural networks have revolutionized robotics by enabling machines to learn from experience and adapt to new situations. This chapter explores how deep learning techniques are applied to robotic systems.

# Perception Systems

Modern robots use advanced perception systems to understand their environment. Computer vision, powered by convolutional neural networks (CNNs), allows robots to identify objects, navigate spaces, and interact with humans.

### Visual Perception Pipeline

The visual perception pipeline typically consists of several stages:
1. Image acquisition from cameras
2. Preprocessing and normalization
3. Feature extraction using CNNs
4. Object detection and segmentation
5. Scene understanding

# Learning from Demonstration

### Imitation Learning

Imitation learning allows robots to learn tasks by observing human demonstrations. This approach is particularly useful for complex manipulation tasks that are difficult to program manually.

```python title="Neural Network for Imitation Learning"
# Imitation Learning Example
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ImitationNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, 256)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(256, 128)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(128, output_dim)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.relu(self.fc2(x))
        return torch.tanh(self.fc3(x))
```

### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning enables robots to learn optimal behaviors through interaction with their environment. The agent receives rewards for desired actions and learns to maximize cumulative reward over time.

> The combination of deep neural networks with reinforcement learning has led to breakthroughs in robotic manipulation, locomotion, and navigation.

# Advanced Topics

### Multi-Modal Fusion

Robots often need to integrate information from multiple sensors—vision, touch, audio, and proprioception—to make informed decisions.

#### Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion

| Sensors        | Features               |
|----------------|------------------------|
| RGB Cameras    | Object Detection       |
| Depth Sensors  | 3D Position           |
| Microphones    | Sound Recognition     |
| Force Sensors  | Force Feedback        |

:::warning Challenge
Sensor fusion requires careful synchronization and calibration to ensure accurate and reliable perception.
